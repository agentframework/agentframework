---

:lollipop: **Modernize:** 100% for TypeScript. Support class and [es6 module](https://unpkg.com/agentframework/).

:zap: **Fast:** Use CodeGen to minimize overheads. Faster than es6 Proxy.

:dart: **Efficient:** Well-designed and crafted api only has **600 SLOC** and **4.3kb** after gzipped.

:recycle: **Productive:** AOP as easy as function calls. Stop using overweight Before/After/Aware hooks.

## Features

-   Add metadata to your code at design-time (using @decorator) or runtime (using Reflector api)
-   Access the metadata at runtime (using Reflector api)
-   Customizable initializer for class fields and arguments
-   Customizable interceptor for injected value, class method, getter, setter and arguments

## Projects

-   [@agentframework/web-starter](https://github.com/agentframework/web-starter) A revolutionary framework crafted for software agents and micro services.
-   [@agentframework/domain](https://github.com/agentframework/domain) **On demand** dependency injection framework [example](https://github.com/agentframework/domain-example)
-   [@agentframework/validation](https://github.com/agentframework/validation) **Zero configuration** validation framework [example](https://github.com/agentframework/validation-example)

## Agent Oriented Programming

### Principle

| PARADIGM                   | INSPIRATION | PRINCIPLE                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Function Programming       | Math        | It transform data                                     |
| OOP                        | The world   | It describe things and the relationships between them |
| Agent Oriented Programming | Human       | It actions like a human (AI)                          |

### Concepts

| HUMAN       | AGENT FRAMEWORK | DESCRIPTION                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People      | Agent           | A class decorate with @agent attribute                                  |
| Action      | Behavior        | Class method decorate with @action, @method or @behavior attribute      |
| Belief      | Memory          | Private class field decorated with @state, @remember, @memory attribute |
| Environment | Domain          | A set of agents, components, services, artifacts                        |
| Autonomy    | Activation      | Timer, scheduler which based on environment conditions                  |
| Sociality   | Message         | Agent can communicate with other agent                                  |
| Mobility    | Mobile Agent    | An agent can move from domain to domain with their belief unchanged     |

### When use Agent Framework

-   You want to build software agents.
-   You want to use dependence injection or dependence lookup.
-   You want to build a framework which similar to Spring Framework but in JavaScript.
-   You want to build an abstract layer for a specific business domain in your organization.
-   You want to remove duplicated code and keep project codebase small and clean.
-   You need a powerful method to pre-process, post-process or modify system behaviors without touching existing code.

### Show me the example

Only 3 lines before you get powerful dependency injection for your code

```typescript
import { agent, transit } from '@agentframework/domain';

class Project {
	name = 'Agent Framework';
}

@agent()
class Developer {
  
	@transit()
	private project: Project;
	
	constructor() {
		console.log(`WOW! You working on project ${this.project.name}!`);
	}
}

const you = new Developer();
console.log('Is it create from the Developer class?', you instanceof Developer);
```

### Road to v1.0

-   [x] MVP: Reflection can access type information generated by tsc. `tsc --emitDecoratorMetadata`
-   [x] MVP: Reflection support both ES6 and ES2017 (Reflect.metadata)
-   [x] MVP: Share metadata across different agentframework library of same application
-   [x] MVP: Both agent or normal class can be used for dependence injection
-   [x] MVP: Add IInitializer to init a field property
-   [x] MVP: Interceptor can work with Initializer during dependence injection
-   [x] EPIC: Create agent without domain
-   [x] EPIC: Provide access to intercepted property value in constructor
-   [x] PERFORMANCE: Metadata only attribute, attribute without interceptor
-   [x] PERFORMANCE: Pre-compile class member interceptors to improve method call performance
-   [x] PERFORMANCE: Cache class constructor interceptors to faster initialize new class instance staring from second time.
-   [x] PERFORMANCE: Remove interceptor for @agent attribute to improve performance
-   [x] PERFORMANCE: Do not add proxy if the agent don't have interceptor
-   [x] PERFORMANCE: Remove ES6 Proxy if don't have field interceptor
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Move @inject and @ready decorator out from core
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: GetPrototypeOf should return origin prototype
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Agent should works in extended classes
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: instanceOf should works when compile to proxy
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise IInvocation Interface
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise IInitializer Interface
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise IInterceptor Interface
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise IAttribute Interface
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise Reflection Interface
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise Reflector Interface
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise Agent Options
-   [x] COMPATIBILITY: Revise Domain Interface (Domain is been completely removed from agentframework)
-   [x] Satellite projects to build AgentFramework.com - Database support - mongodb 4.x
-   [x] Satellite projects to build AgentFramework.com - Serverless support - AWS lambda, Alicloud Function Computing
-   [x] Satellite projects to build AgentFramework.com - Data Validation
-   [x] Satellite projects to build AgentFramework.com - Domain
-   [ ] Satellite projects to build AgentFramework.com - Web Application Support
